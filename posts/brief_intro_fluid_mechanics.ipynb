    "> Fluid mechanics is the branch of physics concerned with the mechanics of fluids (liquids, gases, and plasmas) and the forces on them.\n",

    "In principle, we can describe a fluid’s behavior by tracking all of its particles over time. However, this is often impractical --- consider the [Avogadro constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avogadro_constant): about 18 gram of water contains approximately $6.02 \\times 10^{23}$ molecules. For this reason, we usually treat a fluid as a continuous medium (also known as *continuum*) ignoring the discrete particles. Specifically in fluid mechanics, we assume that fluids consist of [fluid elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_parcel) --- volumes that are small enough to be treated as points, yet large enough to contain many molecules. This allows us to define macroscopic properties such as density, pressure, and (bulk) velocity at each point in the fluid."
